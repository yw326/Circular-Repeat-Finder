# MicroDNA_Detection

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient algorithm to locate potential microDNAs within DNA sequences. Each potential microDNA is mathematically defined as a circle repeat, with form "...s1s2...s2s1..." (direct circle repeat), and "...s1s2...s1^(-1)s2^(-1)..." (reversed circle repeat). The algorithm works by (1) building a suffix tree and finding all the maximal repeated pairs, (2) checking extensions of each repeated pair for potential circle repeat using KMP, (3) calculating edit-distance of KMP matches to determine whether it's an approximate match.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
